# A-Front-End-Web-Developer

I am a frontend developer who have 5 years experiences with Vue.js, React.js, Angular.js and so on.
During that period, I have developed a lot of project including e-commerce websites, online fashion model sites, e-government system, etc.
Of course, I have experiences in the backend development with Laravel and Spring and Node js and so on.
But especially I have developed the frontend and integrated with API.

Recently I performed the project with React.js and Google firebase. If you want, I can provide the link and the whole source code of this project.

If you give me a chance, you'll have a good result perfectly. Please provide me with all the more details regarding the work.
Looking forward to your response.

Good luck.
